  <h1> Tips to remember </h1>
  
  <b> Feature Scaling </b>
  - Feature Scaling is important as it will improve the speed of the algorithm (such as Decision trees).
  - No need to apply feature scaling to dependent variables with binary values, but when we are performing regression on a dataset with a dependent variable that has a large range of values.
